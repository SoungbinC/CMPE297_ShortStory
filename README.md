# Taxonomy and Advances in Prompting Techniques for Generative AI: A Survey-Based Overview

Generative AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), have gained prominence across industries and research domains. Their effectiveness hinges on the design and utilization of prompts—instructions guiding the models’ outputs. Below is a synthesis of the taxonomy and techniques derived from the uploaded survey paper and broader research.

# Taxonomy of Prompting Techniques

## 1. Text-Based Prompting

-   **Zero-Shot Prompting**:  
    The model performs tasks with minimal instruction, relying on training data generalizations.

-   **Few-Shot Prompting**:  
    The model is given examples to better tailor its outputs.

-   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**:  
    Encourages step-by-step reasoning to improve complex problem-solving.

## 2. Multimodal Prompting

-   Combines text, image, video, and audio inputs for comprehensive task handling.

## 3. Multilingual Prompting

-   Focused on extending LLM capabilities to non-English languages.

## 4. Decomposition Techniques

-   Techniques like **Least-to-Most** and **Tree-of-Thought** for breaking complex problems into sub-tasks.

## 5. Self-Criticism and Verification

-   Methods like **Self-Refine** and **Chain-of-Verification** to iteratively improve and validate outputs.

## 6. Ensembling Techniques

-   Aggregates results from multiple prompts to improve reliability and accuracy.

## 7. Agents and Tool Use

-   Integration of external tools (e.g., retrieval systems) to augment reasoning capabilities.

# Highlights of Top Techniques

### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

-   Demonstrates significant improvements in tasks requiring reasoning, especially in mathematical and logical domains.

### 2. Self-Consistency

-   Enhances reliability by evaluating multiple reasoning paths and voting on the final answer.

### 3. Decomposition (Least-to-Most)

-   Sequentially solves sub-problems, achieving higher accuracy in symbolic and compositional reasoning tasks.

### 4. Zero-Shot-CoT

-   Appends instructions like “Let’s think step-by-step” to prompts, improving task completion without examples.

### 5. Program-of-Thought

-   Generates code snippets as reasoning steps, executed to verify outputs.
